# RedirectChecker
Utility Python script to detect redirects on an input list of URLs

The script only takes a positional argument, which is the path of the file containing the list of URLs to be checked for redirects.

The program substitutes the provided URLs with the respective redirected URLs, if any are detected, and writes the output to a file called "out.txt".

Any duplicates are removed.
